        ### 📋 Next Steps After Creating This Epic
        
        1. Click **"Create sub-issue"** in the issue sidebar to add subtasks
        2. Link existing issues as subtasks using the issue sidebar
        3. Track progress as subtasks are completed
        
        > 💡 **Tip:** Each subtask should be a small, actionable work item that can be assigned and completed independently.
