# Known NPM Warnings

## node-domexception deprecation

**Warning:**
```
npm warn deprecated node-domexception@1.0.0: Use your platform's native DOMException instead
```

**Source:** This warning comes from a transitive dependency chain:
- `swagger-ui-react` → `swagger-client` → `node-fetch-commonjs` → `node-domexception@1.0.0`

**Status:** **Ignored** - This is a known deprecation warning from a third-party dependency.

**Reason:** 
- This is a transitive dependency we don't directly control
- The deprecated package is used by `node-fetch-commonjs`, which is used by `swagger-client`
- There is no security vulnerability, just a deprecation notice
- The warning will resolve itself when upstream packages update to newer versions
- Modern Node.js (16+) and browsers have native DOMException support

**Action Required:** None. This warning is safe to ignore.
